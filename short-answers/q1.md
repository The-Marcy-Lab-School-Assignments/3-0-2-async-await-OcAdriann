# Question
Using `async`/`await` over `.then`/`.catch` makes our code for handling promises much more readable. What are the ways in which `async`/`await` is more readable than `.then` and `.catch`?

# Answer
Using `async`/`await` is more readable than using `.then`/`.catch` because it enables us to executwe our code sequentially. `async`/`await` also allows us to use `try` and `catch` to help read the code easier, debug, avoid having to write a bunch of callbacks and avoid common mistakes when using callbacks. We can also handle errors better in a more generalized way
